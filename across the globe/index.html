        <div id="one">
            <p class="p2">Ronit says his mentors always made him feel homely and friendly. Even when he was a newbie in
                the internship,
                still he was allowed with full authority to take decisions on his own and be a part of the team. He
                gained
                enough experience and admitted that he enjoyed learning this way.</p>

            <p class="p3">Vishal Verma admits nor did he only learn a lot of technical skills but also worked with a lot
                of people. He was
                also engaged in different group discussions which amplified his interest of learning and working with
                the team.
